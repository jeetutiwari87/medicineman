From Canada Post

The investigation involves contacting the addressee to confirm delivery, or to better understand how they receive their mail and, as applicable, if they checked:

with the front desk, security or mail room at the receiving address to see if someone else accepted the item on their behalf;

their Community Mail Box for the item or parcel compartment key;

around their property to see if the item was left in a safe location or in a mailbox attached to their home.

In rare cases, a delivery scan is entered into our system before the item is delivered. If you become aware that the addressee has received the item before we contact you, simply reply to this e-mail indicating the item has been received.‚Äù[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title="Q4: Why was my package sent with a ‚ÄúSignature Required‚Äù?" tab_id="1504686244760-c5665427-91b1"][vc_column_text]A4: All orders over $500 will be sent with Signature Required.

The more A‚Äôs the higher the quality with AAAA (quads) usually being the highest.

A -
quality: bush/very low quality
AA - also known as: ‚Äúdubs‚Äù, ‚Äúdouble A‚Äù
quality: low quality
AAA - also known as: ‚Äútrips‚Äù, ‚Äútriple A‚Äù
quality: good/high quality
Note: we have ‚Äúhigh trips‚Äù and ‚Äúlow trips‚Äù this is where most of the dispensaries begin mislabelling their cannabis.
AAAA - also known as: ‚Äúquads‚Äù
quality: high/highest quality
Note: again, we have ‚Äúhigh quads‚Äù and ‚Äúlow quads‚Äù this is where more mislabelling happens.

With that being said‚Ä¶ Everyone ends up labelling quality based on their own in-house quality. If most of their shelves are at the ‚Äútrips‚Äù (AAA) level then they‚Äôll end up putting their lower trips as AA or AAA and labelling their high trips as ‚Äúquads‚Äù. Hence making it difficult for the consumer to know the real quality of a store until they‚Äôve purchased from multiple <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadianMOMs/wiki/momlist" target="_blank" rel="noopener">e-dispensaries</a> to really compare.

Another thing to consider is cannabis quality is increasing every single year, if not every season. It is probably the fastest evolving plant on the planet at the moment with so many great growers coming out with new and innovative ways to grow even higher quality cannabis. This again increases the quads (AAAA) range. We wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if some people have begun calling their cannabis AAAAA (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quints</a>‚Ä¶?) quality :/[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][/vc_tta_accordion][vc_tta_accordion c_position="right" active_section="1"][vc_tta_section title="Q3: I received my order, but it‚Äôs damaged, What should I do ?" tab_id="1504687464606-9a42559f-c5a8"][vc_column_text]A3: If you requested your order with XpressPost <a href="mailto:inquiries@medicinemanshop.ca">send us</a> clear images of the damaged product with your order ID and one of our customer service reps will assist you.
