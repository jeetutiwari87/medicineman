In fact, choosing the best soil for cannabis is one of the most important decisions youâ€™ll make in the process of growing your own pot plants. Itâ€™s so important, it can mean the difference between a successfulÂ </span><span>harvest</span><span>Â and complete failure. Which would you rather have: bountiful buds or a plant so unhealthy you canâ€™t even compost it next year? Thatâ€™s what using the right soil can do. A lotâ€™s riding on your choice.</span>

<span>But what is the best soil for cannabis?Â </span><span>What</span><span>â€™s the best pH?Â </span><span>What</span><span>Â if youâ€™re growing outdoors?Â </span><span>What</span><span>Â if youâ€™re growing indoors? The questionsÂ </span><span>literallyÂ </span><span>go on and on and on. But never fear, my friend. The experts at Honest Marijuana are here to help! Weâ€™ve produced the definitive guide to the best soils for cannabis so you donâ€™t have to worry about your head exploding while trying to sift through all the information. Letâ€™s start our dirt-y adventure by discussing the basics of good cannabis soil.</span>
<h2><strong>The Basics Of Good Cannabis Soil</strong></h2>
<span>CannabisÂ </span><span>is often considered</span><span>Â a weed (hence the name) because the plant can pop up and thrive in diverse conditions. But that doesnâ€™t mean you should just scatter your sensimilla seeds in the backyard and hope for the best. This isnâ€™t Jack &amp; The Beanstalk, bro. Yes, your cannabis weed can grow in a wide range of soils, but toÂ </span><span>trulyÂ </span><span>flourishâ€”to produce lots ofÂ </span><span>trichomes</span><span>, THC, and other cannabinoidsâ€”it needs just the right balance of variables in the soil. These variables include:</span>
<ul>
 	<li><span>Proper drainage</span></li>
 	<li><span>Good water retention (sounds counterintuitive to the first variable, but itâ€™s not)</span></li>
 	<li><span>Correct nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (thisÂ </span><span>is done</span><span>Â in the composting phase)</span></li>
 	<li><span>The right balance of fungus to bacteria (a slight skew to the fungal side of the spectrum is okay because cannabis prefersÂ </span><span>slightlyÂ </span><span>acidic soil)</span></li>
 	<li><span>Soil pH of 6</span></li>
