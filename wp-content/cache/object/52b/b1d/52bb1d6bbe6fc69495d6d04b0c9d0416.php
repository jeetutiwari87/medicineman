The herb was bred in 1995 in Great Britain by an alternative community called Exodus. Hence, the strain is also called Exodus Cheese. The bud is distributed by Shaman Genetics. Staying true to the name, UK Cheese cannabis plants grow massive buds that strongly smell of cheese. The nugs are drenched with resin. UK Cheese marijuana is potent and delivers a good punch, as THC levels reach up to 20%. The weed is good for daytime use.
