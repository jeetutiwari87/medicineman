Hence, the strain is also called Exodus Cheese. The bud is distributed by Shaman Genetics. Staying true to the name, UK Cheese cannabis plants grow massive buds that strongly smell of cheese. The nugs are drenched with resin. UK Cheese marijuana is potent and delivers a good punch, as THC levels reach up to 20%. The weed is good for daytime use. UK Cheese marijuana induces uplifting cerebral euphoria and body buzz followed by relaxation and couch-lock. May cause headaches, paranoia and dry eyes.
